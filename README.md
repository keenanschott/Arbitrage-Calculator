## Setup

The text field at the top of the page is designed for a [the-odds-api](https://the-odds-api.com/) key - the table will display live arbitrage betting opportunities once a valid key is submitted.

## Arbitrage Betting

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage_betting), betting arbitrage is an example of [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) arising on betting markets due to either [bookmakers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker) differing opinions on event outcomes, or errors. When conditions allow, by placing one bet per each outcome with different betting companies, the bettor can make a profit regardless of the outcome. Mathematically, arbitrage occurs when there are a set of odds, which represent all mutually exclusive outcomes that cover all state space possibilities (i.e. all outcomes) of an event, whose implied probabilities add up to less than 1.

## Closing Remarks

This project welcomes open-source contributions. While I personally prefer to keep the site simple and lightweight, I am open to adopting a web framework if greater complexity becomes necessary. However, as long as this remains primarily a personal tool, I am inclined to avoid developing a back-end or incorporating web frameworks.
